## The Core Feeling

Between Us is a **quiet place** two people share. It's not a tool,
not a tracker, not a coach. It's the digital equivalent of lying in bed
together, phones down, just… talking. Every word we write should feel
like it belongs in that space.

**Brand line:** *Where closeness deepens.*

## Voice Principles

| Principle | What it means | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Warm, never clinical** | We never sound like a therapist's worksheet. | ✅ "Your story starts here" · ❌ "No entries found" |
| **Intimate, never performative** | We don't cheer or gamify. Connection isn't a sport. | ✅ "3 nights connected" · ❌ "Streak 🔥 Keep it up!" |
| **Present, not pushy** | We suggest, never demand. The couple decides. | ✅ "Whenever you're ready…" · ❌ "Don't forget to complete today's prompt!" |
| **Confident quiet** | Short sentences. Let the space breathe. | ✅ "Something beautiful awaits ✨" · ❌ "AMAZING! You both answered!" |
| **Honest, not salesy** | Premium features are invitations, not gates. | ✅ "Discover deeper moments" · ❌ "UPGRADE NOW to unlock!" |

## Between Us ALWAYS…

- Uses **first names or "love"** — never "User" or "you"
- Treats the **couple as equals** — partner's premium unlocks for both
- Puts **privacy front and center** — encrypted by default, no cloud without consent
- Feels **handcrafted** — like someone cared about every word
- Respects **silence** — not every screen needs a subtitle
- Celebrates **small moments** — a quiet journal entry matters as much as a milestone

## Between Us NEVER…

- Uses **gamification language**: streak, points, score, level up, achievement unlocked, leaderboard, challenge, badge, rank
- Uses **clinical/analytical language**: relationship health, engagement score, churn, retention, conversion, funnel, optimization
- **Shames inactivity**: "You haven't journaled in 3 days!" → Instead, stay quiet or say "Welcome back 💜"
- Uses **ALL CAPS** for excitement (except subtle eyebrow labels like "TODAY'S PROMPT")
- Shows **countdown timers** or urgency tactics for purchases
- Uses **manipulative dark patterns**: "Are you sure you want to miss out?"
- Sends **guilt-based notifications**: "Your partner is waiting…" with a red badge
- **Compares couples**: no rankings, no "other couples also…", no benchmarks
- Uses the word **"user"** in any visible UI

## Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Empty states** | Gently inviting | "Your story starts here" |
| **Errors** | Honest, brief, warm | "Something didn't work — try again?" |
| **Loading** | Quiet patience | "Finding something meaningful…" |
| **Premium upsell** | Calm invitation | "This is part of the deeper experience" |
| **Notifications** | Soft nudge | "A new prompt is waiting whenever you're ready" |
| **Milestones** | Quiet celebration | "100 days together 💛" |
| **Night ritual** | Hushed, moonlit | "Let the day go. Just us now." |
| **Onboarding** | Welcoming, unhurried | "Let's make this yours" |
| **Delete/export** | Respectful, no guilt | "Your memories, your choice" |
| **Partner waiting** | Gentle, never pressuring | "Waiting on love's heart…" |

## Visual Tone — Midnight Intimacy Palette

- **Dark theme only** — Ink-black (#070509) background, soft cream text (#F2E9E6)
- **Charcoal-plum surfaces** (#131016) — cards, inputs, elevated UI elements
- **Surface-plum** (#1C1520) — secondary surfaces, subtle elevation
- **Surface-elevated** (#241C28) — tertiary surfaces, modal overlays
- **Wine accent** (#7A1E4E) — primary CTAs, active states, key interactions
- **Mulberry accent** (#9A2E5E) — secondary accent, links, subtle highlights
- **Wine-deep** (#4C1030) — gradient endpoints, deep accent
- **Matte gold** (#A89060) — **premium-only**, never in main UI. Reserved for Pro badge, paywall, milestones.
- **Plum vignette** (#1A0D18) — atmospheric gradient backgrounds
- **No teal, no green, no bright pink** — the palette is plum, wine, and cream only
- **Glass/blur effects** — plum-tinted glass `rgba(28,21,32,...)`, everything feels layered and soft
- **Borders** — white at very low opacity: `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` — never raw white, never colored
- **No hard borders** — rounded corners (cards: 20, buttons: 16, pills: 999), subtle gradients, breathing space
- **Shadows**: Dramatically reduced — max opacity 0.12, mostly 0.04–0.08
- **Animations**: Gentle. Slow fades (250–1000ms), soft springs (damping 20–25). Never bouncy or attention-seeking.

## Premium Philosophy

Premium in Between Us is an **invitation to go deeper**, not a wall.
Free users can preview a taste of the experience — 3 read-only prompts across
heat levels 1-3. Premium unlocks everything: unlimited prompts, responses,
love notes, calendar, partner connection, cloud sync, and ongoing new content.

**Never say:**
- "You've reached your limit"
- "Upgrade to continue"
- "You can't do that"

**Instead say:**
- "Discover the full experience"
- "There's more waiting for you"
- "This is part of the deeper journey"
- "Premium unlocks responding, saving, sharing, and everything else"

---

## Notification Philosophy

Notifications are a privilege, not a right. Every notification must pass
this test: **"Would I want to receive this while lying next to my partner?"**

If the answer is no, don't send it.

- Maximum 1 notification per day
- Never guilt-based
- Always dismissable
- Never reveal private content in the preview
