## Getting Started

### What is Between Us?
Between Us is a couples app built around one idea: where closeness deepens. Through daily prompts, shared journaling, and intimate rituals, it gives you and your partner a private space to connect more meaningfully.

**Important:** Between Us is designed for couples who already have a loving foundation and want to deepen their intimacy and connection.

### Who is Between Us for?
Between Us is for couples who are already in a good place and want to deepen their intimacy and connection. If your relationship has a strong foundation and you want to make it even richer, this app is for you.

**Important:** Between Us is designed for couples who already have a **loving foundation**. It is **not appropriate** for couples experiencing:
- Serious relationship concerns
- Trust breakdowns or infidelity
- Communication breakdowns
- Considering separation or divorce
- Abuse or safety concerns
- Mental health crises

If your relationship needs professional support, please seek qualified counseling or therapy. Between Us deepens what's already beautiful — it's not a substitute for professional care.

### Is Between Us for all couples?
Between Us works for couples of all orientations and identities — our prompts are universally designed. It's specifically for couples who already have a **loving foundation** and want to deepen their intimacy and connection.

**All couples welcome (by orientation/identity):**
- All sexual orientations
- All gender identities
- All relationship structures
- All backgrounds and cultures
- Any length of relationship

**But designed for couples who are:**
- Already in a loving, safe place
- Wanting to deepen their intimacy and connection
- Feeling safe and respected
- Excited to explore together
- Looking to grow closer and go deeper

**Not appropriate for couples experiencing:**
- Serious relationship concerns
- Trust breakdowns or infidelity
- Communication breakdowns
- Considering separation
- Abuse or safety concerns

So yes, all couples are welcome in terms of who you are — but the app is specifically designed for couples who already have a loving foundation and want to deepen their intimacy and connection.

## Account & Setup

### Do I need my partner to use the app?
No! You can use Between Us solo to:
- Journal your thoughts
- Reflect on your relationship
- Prepare conversation topics
- Track your growth

However, linking with your partner unlocks shared features and makes the experience more interactive.

### How do I link with my partner?
1. Both partners create accounts
2. One partner generates a link code
3. The other partner enters the code
4. Both partners confirm the link
5. You're connected!

### Can I unlink from my partner?
Yes, either partner can unlink at any time:
- Your individual data remains private
- Shared content is removed from both accounts
- You can relink later if desired
- No judgment, no questions asked

### What if my partner doesn't want to use the app?
That's okay! You can still:
- Use prompts as conversation starters in person
- Journal your own responses
- Reflect on your relationship
- Track your personal growth

### Can I have multiple partners?
Currently, Between Us supports one linked partner at a time. If you're in a polyamorous relationship, you can use the app with one partner or use separate accounts.

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data private?
Absolutely. We take privacy seriously:
- Your journal entries are end-to-end encrypted
- We never sell your data
- We can't read your encrypted content
- Only you and your linked partner can see shared content

### Can my partner see everything I write?
No! You control what you share:

- You choose what to share and when
- Your partner can't access your private thoughts
- You can delete shared content anytime

### What happens if we break up?
- You can unlink from your partner

No! Your journal entries, prompt responses, and love notes are end-to-end encrypted:

**Note:** Some metadata (timestamps, mood labels, heat-level preferences) is not encrypted so the app can provide features like filtering and calendar views. This metadata is protected by access controls and standard server-side encryption.

### Does the app collect biometric data?
No. Between Us uses your device's built-in Face ID or Touch ID for app lock, but no biometric data is ever collected, stored, or transmitted by the app. Authentication happens entirely within your device's secure hardware (Secure Enclave on iOS, StrongBox/TEE on Android).

### What data stays only on my device?
Many features store data exclusively on your device:

## About Between Us & Your Relationship

### Is Between Us a substitute for therapy?
No. Between Us is a connection experience, not therapy:
- We provide prompts, not counseling
- **The app is designed for couples who already have a loving foundation — it deepens intimacy and closeness**
- Serious concerns need professional support
- We encourage open, loving communication
- A licensed therapist is the right resource for serious concerns

**When to seek professional help instead:**
- You're navigating ongoing relationship concerns
- There are trust breakdowns or infidelity
- You're considering separation
- There's abuse or safety concerns
- Communication has broken down
- You feel stuck or uncertain about your relationship

Between Us works best when your relationship is fundamentally healthy and you want to make it even better.

### What if prompts surface something tender?
Prompts can surface important topics:
- Use them as conversation starters
- Approach with openness and honesty
- **If serious concerns emerge, seek professional support**
- Remember: Communication is key

**Red flags that indicate you need professional help:**
- Prompts consistently lead to arguments
- You're avoiding certain prompts due to discomfort
- Responses reveal deep-seated resentment
- You feel unsafe sharing honestly
- Something feels too big to navigate alone

Between Us deepens what's already beautiful — it's not a substitute for professional care. If using the app surfaces something important, that's valuable — and a sign to seek professional support.

### What if my partner and I disagree on prompts?
Healthy disagreement is normal! However:
- **Minor differences:** Great opportunity for discussion
- **Repeated tension:** May suggest something deeper to explore with a professional
- **Feeling unsafe:** Seek professional help immediately

Between Us works best when both partners feel safe, respected, and excited to connect. If the app is creating tension rather than closeness, it may not be the right time.

### When should we NOT use Between Us?
Don't use Between Us if you're:
- Navigating a relationship crisis
- Working through infidelity or trust breakdowns
- Experiencing abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual)
- Considering separation or divorce
- In couples therapy for serious concerns (ask your therapist first)
- Feeling unsafe with your partner
- Using it to avoid what needs professional attention

**Use Between Us when:**
- Your relationship is fundamentally healthy
- You want to deepen your connection
- You're excited to explore together
- You feel safe and respected
- You want to maintain relationship vitality
- You're looking for fun ways to connect

### Is Between Us right for every couple?
**Between Us is designed for couples who are in a good place.** It's not for every situation:
- It’s for couples who already have a loving foundation and want to deepen their intimacy and connection
- It's not a substitute for professional support
- It's not a substitute for therapy or counseling
- Professional support is the right path for serious concerns

**If you're experiencing:**
- Ongoing tension or frequent disagreements
- Trust breakdowns or betrayal
- Communication breakdowns
- Emotional distance or disconnection
- Considering separation
- Abuse or safety concerns

**Please seek professional help from:**
- Licensed couples therapist
- Marriage counselor
- Relationship coach
- Mental health professional

Between Us can complement therapy for couples who are already in a good place, but it should not replace professional support when serious concerns are present.

### Is Between Us only for romantic relationships?
While designed for romantic couples, the prompts can work for:
- Long-term committed partners
- Married couples
- Engaged couples
- Serious dating relationships
