## Relationship Advice

### Is Between Us a substitute for therapy?
No. Between Us is a tool for connection, not therapy:
- We provide prompts, not counseling
- **The app is designed for thriving couples, not those in crisis**
- Serious issues need professional help
- We encourage healthy communication
- Seek a therapist for relationship problems

**When to seek professional help instead:**
- You're experiencing ongoing conflict
- There are trust issues or infidelity
- You're considering separation
- There's abuse or safety concerns
- Communication has broken down
- You feel stuck or hopeless about your relationship

Between Us works best when your relationship is fundamentally healthy and you want to make it even better.

### What if prompts reveal relationship issues?
Prompts can surface important topics:
- Use them as conversation starters
- Approach with openness and honesty
- **If serious issues emerge, seek professional help**
- Remember: Communication is key

**Red flags that indicate you need professional help:**
- Prompts consistently lead to arguments
- You're avoiding certain prompts due to conflict
- Responses reveal deep-seated resentment
- You feel unsafe sharing honestly
- Issues feel too big to handle alone

Between Us is designed for enhancement, not repair. If using the app reveals serious problems, that's valuable information—and a sign to seek professional support.

### What if my partner and I disagree on prompts?
Healthy disagreement is normal! However:
- **Minor differences:** Great opportunity for discussion
- **Frequent conflict:** May indicate deeper issues
- **Feeling unsafe:** Seek professional help immediately

Between Us works best when both partners feel safe, respected, and excited to connect. If the app is causing stress rather than joy, it may not be the right time to use it.

### When should we NOT use Between Us?
Don't use Between Us if you're:
- In active conflict or crisis
- Dealing with infidelity or trust issues
- Experiencing abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual)
- Considering separation or divorce
- In couples therapy for serious issues (ask your therapist first)
- Feeling unsafe with your partner
- Using it to avoid addressing real problems

**Use Between Us when:**
- Your relationship is fundamentally healthy
- You want to deepen your connection
- You're excited to explore together
- You feel safe and respected
- You want to maintain relationship vitality
- You're looking for fun ways to connect

### Can Between Us save a struggling relationship?
**No.** Between Us is not designed for couples in crisis:
- It's for thriving couples who want to deepen their connection
- It cannot fix serious relationship problems
- It's not a substitute for therapy or counseling
- Professional help is needed for struggling relationships

**If you're experiencing:**
- Frequent conflict or fighting
- Trust issues or betrayal
- Communication breakdowns
- Emotional distance or disconnection
- Considering separation
- Abuse or safety concerns

**Please seek professional help from:**
- Licensed couples therapist
- Marriage counselor
- Relationship coach
- Mental health professional

Between Us can complement therapy for couples working on their relationship, but it should not replace professional support when serious issues exist.
