# Privacy in Plain English

**Your privacy matters. Here's what you need to know.**

---

## 🔒 Your Data is Protected

### What We Encrypt (End-to-End)
✅ Your journal entries
✅ Your responses to prompts
✅ Love notes and photo attachments
✅ Shared memories and milestones

### What We Encrypt (Device-Level)
✅ Daily check-ins (mood, closeness, notes)
✅ Relationship memories
✅ Inside jokes and shared references
✅ Relationship climate selections

### What We Don't Encrypt (But Still Protect)
⚠️ Metadata like timestamps, mood labels, and heat-level preferences  
⚠️ Calendar events and date plans  
⚠️ Nickname and tone settings  

**Why:** Metadata isn’t encrypted so the app can filter, sort, and display your content. It’s still protected by access controls and standard server encryption — just not end-to-end.

**How E2EE works:** Your journal entries are encrypted on your device before upload. Only you and your partner can read them. Not even we can see them.

## 🚫 What We Never Do

❌ **Sell your data** - Never. Not to anyone.  
❌ **Share with advertisers** - Your intimate moments aren't for sale.  
❌ **Track you across apps** - We only care about Between Us.  
❌ **Read your journal** - It's encrypted. We literally can't.  
❌ **Ask about your orientation** - Love is love. That's all we need to know.
❌ **Store your biometrics** - Face ID/Touch ID runs on your device's hardware only.
