# Privacy in Plain English

**Your privacy matters. Here's what you need to know.**

---

## 🔒 Your Data is Protected

### What We Encrypt
✅ Your journal entries  
✅ Your responses to prompts  
✅ Your shared memories  
✅ Everything intimate  

**How:** End-to-end encryption means your content is encrypted on your device before upload. Only you and your partner can read it. Not even we can see it.

---

## 🚫 What We Never Do

❌ **Sell your data** - Never. Not to anyone.  
❌ **Share with advertisers** - Your intimate moments aren't for sale.  
❌ **Track you across apps** - We only care about Between Us.  
❌ **Read your journal** - It's encrypted. We literally can't.  
❌ **Ask about your orientation** - Love is love. That's all we need to know.
