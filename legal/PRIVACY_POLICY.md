## 3. Data Security and Encryption

### 3.1 End-to-End Encryption (Couple Key)
**Your intimate content is protected with E2EE:**
- Journal entries, prompt responses, and love notes are encrypted on your device before upload
- Only you and your linked partner can decrypt encrypted content
- We cannot read your encrypted journal entries, prompt responses, or love notes
- Encryption keys are derived via X25519 key exchange during partner pairing and never stored on our servers
- Partner pairing uses QR codes containing only a couple ID and a public key — no personal data

### 3.2 Device-Level Encryption
**Additional local data is encrypted with a device-specific key:**
- Love notes and photo attachments
- Daily check-ins (mood, closeness, and notes)
- Relationship memories and milestones
- Inside jokes and shared references
- Relationship climate selections

This data is encrypted on your device using a key stored in your phone's secure hardware (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android). It cannot be read by extracting the app's storage files.

**Note:** Some metadata (such as timestamps, event types, mood labels, and heat-level preferences) is stored without end-to-end encryption so we can provide features like filtering, sorting, and calendar scheduling. This metadata is still protected by TLS in transit and access controls at rest.

### 3.3 Security Measures
We implement industry-standard security:
- TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit
- Client-side encryption using XSalsa20-Poly1305 (NaCl secretbox)
- Encrypted storage at rest by our cloud provider
- Secure authentication protocols
- Access controls and monitoring

### 3.4 Device-Only Data
**The following data is stored exclusively on your device and never uploaded:**
- Soft boundary settings (hidden categories, paused content)
- Energy level and relationship climate selections
- Inside jokes and shared references
- Year reflection narratives
- Content preference history (This or That choices, prompt engagement)
- Welcome back and return-detection timestamps
- Biometric vault key (stored in device secure hardware)

### 3.5 Client-Side Processing
**Privacy by design:**
- Personalization and content recommendations are processed on your device
- No intimate content is sent to servers for analysis
- Prompt selection, energy matching, and filtering happen locally
- Your preference data stays on your device
- Surprise Tonight and content personalization algorithms run locally

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 4.1 With Your Partner
- Content you choose to share is visible to your linked partner
- Vibe signals and moment signals are shared with your linked partner in real time
- Prompt responses can be shared via the Reveal Together feature (both partners must opt in)
- You control what you share and when
- Your partner cannot access your private entries or soft boundary settings
- Unlinking stops all data sharing

### 4.2 With Service Providers
We work with trusted partners who help us operate:
- **Cloud hosting:** Supabase (journal content is E2E encrypted; metadata such as timestamps, mood labels, and couple IDs is stored with standard server-side encryption)

- **Payment processing:** Handled by Apple/Google (we don't see payment details)
- **Customer support:** Only if you contact us

All providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.

We **never** sell or share your data with:
- ❌ Advertisers

### 4.4 Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law:
